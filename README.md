# CS372_marks
A visual analysis of the marks obtained by students enrolled in the course CS372 (Spring 2020). 
The orange cluster of top 20% students in every subplot shows the consistency of the group of students while the bottom 80% (marked blue) have been distributed evenly but do have some outliers who overperformed in a test or two.
Another interesting observation is that there are clear aligned clusters in 'class test' subplots which indicates towards "binary" marking being used for the class test evaluation.
