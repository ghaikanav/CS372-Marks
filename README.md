# CS372_marks
A visual analysis of the marks obtained by students enrolled in the course CS372 (Spring 2020). The orange cluster of top 20% students in every subplot shows the consistency of the group of students while the bottom 80% (marked blue) have been distributed evenly and do have some outliers who overperformed in an assignment or two.
